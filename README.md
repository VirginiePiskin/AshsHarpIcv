# AshsHarpIcv
This repository contains the files used to set up a segmentation pipeline on XNAT (an open-source imaging informatics software platform dedicated to imaging-based research). This pipeline performs a segmentation of the brain and a segmentation of the hippocampal regions using ASHS (Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields) and HARP (Harmonized Hippocampal Protocol).
